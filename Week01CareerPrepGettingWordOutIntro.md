## [My Resume](Resume.pdf) 
# Resume Features:
## I want my resume to mainly focus on the projects I have done, and so I decided to include a page which entirely highlights some important projects, with associated bullet points.
## I also included an objective statement at the top, which is there to highlight what my current goal is in looking for a job.
