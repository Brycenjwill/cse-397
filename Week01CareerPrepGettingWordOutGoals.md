# SMART Goal Study
### Links that I used: [UCOP.EDU](https://www.ucop.edu/local-human-resources/_files/performance-appraisal/How%20to%20write%20SMART%20Goals%20v2.pdf), [INDEED.COM](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/how-to-write-smart-goals), [SNHU.EDU](https://www.snhu.edu/about-us/newsroom/education/what-are-smart-goals)

# Resume Improvements
- I liked how several other students listed what their roles were in each of the projects that they listed. It makes sense that it wouldn't always be obvious that I was one of the developers on a peice of software.
- I also liked how several people put links to the repository for each of their projects next to the project description. This would be a great idea for digital applications.
- The biggest thing I took away from viewing the Linkedin profiles of my classmates is that I need to be more active on Linkedin. I have used it for networking in the past, but my profile would probably be more attractive if it had actual content / posts.

# Job Posting & Evaluation
### [Hertz Software Engineer - New Hire](https://fa-evlf-saasfaprod1.fa.ocs.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_1/job/22183/?utm_medium=jobshare)
- This listing is vague in terms of which technologies / languages they are looking for experience in. However, the listing requests a strong ability to write production level code with moderate supervision. I have experience developing under a team lead, which would be handy in this position.
- The main improvement I would need to make in order to qualify for and perform well in this job would be to learn how to align business needs with software solutions. Most of my time had been spent building software, and so I am inexperienced with eliciting requirements.

### [L3Harris Associate Software Engineer](https://careers.l3harris.com/en/job/salt-lake-city/associate-software-engineer-salt-lake-city-ut/4832/70089467600)
- They are looking for someone with experience in one or more common programming languages / platforms, such as C, C++, Linux, Software Security, .NET, and Windows. Luckily, I have experience with the majority of their listed languages / tools, except for a few such as embedded systems and the Hadoop library.
- In terms of improvements, I think that I would mainly need to focus on practicing software testing. I haven't had the chance to do much software testing outside of the unit level, and testing seems to be a large portion of this position.

### [Anduril Embedded Software Engineer](https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/andurilindustries/jobs/4497074007?gh_jid=4497074007)
- This is more of a dream job of mine. They are looking for someone with professional embedded software engineering experience. I do know the Rust language as they prefer, in no_std environments.
- However, I do not have the professional embedded systems programming experience that they require.

# SMART Goals: 
1. Goal from classmates: I am going to include more attributes that are unrelated to my application within my resume. This will be in an attempt to present myself as a person, rather than just resume data.
2. Goal from job search: I am going to keep applying to jobs as usual. However, I am also going to apply to several internship level embedded systems jobs, so that I can have a chance to gain experience in that field.
